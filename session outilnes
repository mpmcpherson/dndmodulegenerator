Outline of first session as it happened:

		Bird -Knows Driden through bounty hunting in the same area
		Driden -Knows Bird through bounty hunting in the same area
		Ludolf -Knows Osric because he was doing the Little John thing; wrestling people before he'd let them pass. Upon being defeated, he started travelling with Osric because he didn't have anything more intereting to do, and someone who could outwrestle him was a novelty.
		Osric -Knowls Ludolf --see above, was travelling as a courier.


	fought a tree plus seven zombies (four regular zombies, three ogre zombies) 

	discovered smokey quartz crystals with necromantic energy still on them

	proceeded on to the town around Springbrook Keep, which is quite shitty

	Met with the Bailiff of Springbrook Keep, who offered them a job escorting a food shipment up to a gold mining camp. At a rate of 2gp per person per day.
