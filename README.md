# dndmodulegenerator

I got deeply bored rolling out all this stuff by hand and taking it down with pen and paper for my group every week or 
so, so I hacked together this copy of data from the DMG -some with a little twist- and wired up a little random-selection
and concatenation. It's nothing special, but it presents data in a coherent way and lets me get my players on their way
with about twenty minutes of prep (at this point, it's mostly building and reskinning the encounters that takes the most
time --and just watch for a generator for that, too!) rather than several hours while I agonize over the relative merits 
of two almost-identical options.
